The algorithm proceeds through the opencv commands,	Programming language is Python. The larger one is a Star Map, the smaller ones are pictures cropped from the Star Chart. One of the smaller ones matches the Star Map horizontally and vertically, and the other is rotated. 


Firstly, the point found on the star map drawn, then to find the cropped and rotated areas with commands using opencv over different mathematical functions. Here, the same point was always found on the cropped image through  mathematical functions. When we look at the rotated picture, 4 points were found.
